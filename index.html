									<h2><a href="#">About Me</a></h2>
									<p>Hello, my name is Leigh Cohen and I am a Data Analyst with a passion for discovering meaningful insights through data analysis that help create data-driven solutions to real-world problems. I received my B.S. in Mathematial and Scientific Computation with a Biology Emphasis from UC Davis in 2018. Following the university, I was an Algebra and Geometry teacher for 4 years in Samut Prakhan and Chiang Mai, Thailand as well as San Francisco, US. This experience has enhanced my mathematical foundation, communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and creative thinking skills + so much more. Now, I am ready to join the data science space working as a Data Analyst. I have been working on a number of projects in SQL and Python, some of which you can find here in my portfolio, and more on my Github- https://github.com/Leigh3983. When Iâ€™m not geeking out over a data science project, you can find me running, playing piano, practicing MMA, practicing or teaching yoga, and going on hiking adventures.</p>

										1. Use the yfinance library to extract Tesla's and Gamestop's stock data<br />
										2. Use webscraping with the Beautiful Soup library to extract Tesla's and Gamestop's revenue data<br />
										3. Use the make_graph function to plot their historical shareprice and revenue data, and form an analysis<br />
										4. Write an analysis of the historical share price and revenue graphs of each company</p>

										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>I used SQL to query census, crime, and school demographics data sets, with the purpose of finding meaningful insights that can help improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the city of Chicago.

										I identified and analyzed the causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, and environment ratings of schools in order to understand which elements need to be changed, focused on more or less, and which are most critical.</p>

										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p> A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the ability of the HAR smartphone application to identify different basic human motions, with the goal of providing useful information on potential health risks and problems such as motion disorders. Using methods such as PCA and Kmeans clustering, I was able to conclude that the HAR application is able to distinguish between some activities, yet isn't strong enough to accurately distinguish between all the activities measured.</p>

										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>In this project, the question at hand is "how is vision rivalry structured and when will the rivalry make a jump from traditional monocular vision to higher binocular vision?". I used a system of differential equations to computationally model rivalry in both monocular and binocular-driven vision. The model in this study shows that there are two stages in the rivalry hierarchy, one led by traditional monocular rivalry and the second by alternating binocular rivalry.</p>
